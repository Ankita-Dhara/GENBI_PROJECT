# GENBI_PROJECT
This is the project to create a dashboard that takes a database as input and provides insights with proper visualization.
The code is designed to run a streamlit web-app that allows users to ask questions about the data provided,it automaticly generate, execute and visualise SQL queries using langchain and PandasAI.
In this repository there are two files. A (.docx) word file and a Google Colab file (.ipynb). The word file is a document that states all the necessary information such as the requirement and the workflow of the code. The colab file contains the entire code including the required packages.
Please Read the word file for details of the code, before executing the same.
